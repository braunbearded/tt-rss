Fork
=============
This is just a fork from <https://git.tt-rss.org/fox/tt-rss>.
So all props to the guys from <http://tt-rss.org>.

I forked it because deploying ttrss to heroku as a submodule throw some
certificate errors. In case you want to host your own ttrss instance on
heroku check out <https://github.com/serl/ttrss-heroku>. After cloning just
point the url in .gitmodules to this repo.

Includes feedly theme from <https://github.com/levito/tt-rss-feedly-theme>.
